%{
Approach:
Loop through each channel
    Within that channel, loop through each artifact
        The index channel is the candidate stim channel for that artifact
        Loop through every other channel
            Find the closest artifact in time to that 
            Compare sizes of stim artifact between channel i and j
            Take the larger one as the new candidate stim channel
        Procede in this fashion through all channels until we find the
        absolute stim channel for that artifact
    Procede in this fashion for all artifacts
Procede in this fashion for all channels
